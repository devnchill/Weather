## Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devnchill/Weather && cd Weather && npm install && npm run dev
```

This would open chrome . If you don't have chrome , you'll have to manually open it by opening your browser and searching

`localhost:6969`

## Things I'll do later

- Work on CSS . For now did bare minimum
- Implement autocomplete feature when user starts entering location.

## feature

- uses WEBPACK to bundle MODULES
- ts loader for transpiling typescript into javascript
- CSS and style loader for handling CSS
- uses HTML webpack plugin to generate HTML page using template
